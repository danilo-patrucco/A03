depending on the OS you are using you will have to follow different procedures, since I am using Windows 10 i will explain how to install and use GIT in windows.

# -1 Git installation 

Go on the website https://gitforwindows.org/ and download the installer for GIT 
Once the download is completed proceed to install it

# -2 Git Setup

Once GIT is installed proceed to set up the global account data, go in the command prompt and type 

$ git config --global user.name "youruser"
$ git config --global user.email "youremail"

Your GIT is now configured!

# -3 GitHub 

Start with going on the github website https://github.com
Create an account
On the top right side of the page, next to your profile picture there is a plus, click on it
select new repository
Under repository name put the name of your repository
Select public (where you are prompted if you want the repo to be public or private)unless you are planning to keep your repo private

1 GIT = Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.<br/>
2 GitHub = GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.<br/>
3 Repository = a repository is a central file storage location. It is used by version control systems to store multiple versions of files.<br/>
4 Clone = git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository<br/>
5 Commit = The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.<br/>
6 Push = The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. <br/>
7 Pull = The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.<br/>
8 Branch = Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems. Instead of copying files from directory to directory, Git stores a branch as a reference to a commit. In this sense, a branch represents the tip of a series of commitsâ€”it's not a container for commits.<br/>
9 Merge = Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. <br/>
10 Merge Conflict = Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge<br/>
11 Fetch = The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo<br/>
12 Remote = A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server.<br/>
