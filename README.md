1 GIT = Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.<br/>
2 GitHub = GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.<br/>
3 Repository = a repository is a central file storage location. It is used by version control systems to store multiple versions of files.<br/>
4 Clone = git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository<br/>
5 Commit = The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.<br/>
6 Push = The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. <br/>
7 Pull = The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.<br/>
8 Branch = Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems. Instead of copying files from directory to directory, Git stores a branch as a reference to a commit. In this sense, a branch represents the tip of a series of commitsâ€”it's not a container for commits.<br/>
9 Merge = Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. <br/>
10 Merge Conflict = Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge<br/>
11 Fetch = The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo<br/>
12 Remote = A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server.<br/>
